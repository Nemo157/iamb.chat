# Verification

## Incoming Verifications

If another user or one of your other devices has sent you a verification
request, then it will appear in the Verifications list, accessible via running
`:verify` with no arguments.

## Requesting Verifications

If you'd like to verify another user, you can do so by running
`:verify request USERID`. Once they accept, you can check the Emojis and
confirm that they match in the same way as shown above for incoming
verifications.

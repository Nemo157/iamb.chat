## Sending

While the message bar of a room is selected, you can type a message that you
wish to send. When it's complete, you can send it by pressing the `<Enter>`
key from either Normal or Insert mode.

> If you need to type a multiline message, you can start a line by typing
> `^V^J`.  You can also use the `O` and `o` keys to insert a blank line before
> or after the current line respectively.

## Message Scrollback

You can scroll through messages from the message bar using the following keys:

- `^E`/`^Y` to scroll downwards and upwards respectively a line at a time
- `^D`/`^U` to scroll downwards and upwards respectively by half the window height
- `^F`/`^B` to scroll downwards and upwards respectively by the window height

If you want to use movement keys to select individual messages, you can toggle
focus between the message bar and the scrollback by pressing `^Wm`.
